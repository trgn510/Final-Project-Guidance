# Final Project
## Description
Basic Description. 
### Protype
What differentiates a prototype is that it doesn't include all your data, but rather a representation of some of the data.  
A major aspect is creating a unit test, which is a smaller subset of data that can be run quickly to make sure everythinng is setup.
